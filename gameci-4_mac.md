# GameCI 4: Build and Deploy with MacOS

Continuing from [GameCI 3](gameci-3_linux.html), let's examine the `Build with Mac`, `Deploy to the Mac App Store`, and `Deploy to the App Store` jobs.

## Build with Mac

Most of this job should be self-explanatory after reading the [GameCI Builder docs](https://game.ci/docs/github/builder), but here are some additional details:

Instead of using a Linux runner, we need a macOS runner for the StandaloneOSX artifact for a few reasons:
1. StandaloneOSX builds require macOS if using [IL2CPP as the scripting backend](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html). Use IL2CPP for better run-time performance than Mono.
2. I accidentally submitted a bad version to the Apple Store, and now I have to use [a hack in fastlane](https://github.com/finol-digital/Card-Game-Simulator/blob/develop/fastlane/Fastfile#L72) to allow my builds to be submitted to the Apple Store. Be careful when submitting to the App Store!
3. In order for players to download and run a macOS executable, that executable must first be signed using the macOS `codesign` tool.

You may want to refer to both [Apple's code-signing documentation](https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/) as well as [my script for signing mac builds](https://github.com/finol-digital/Card-Game-Simulator/blob/develop/fastlane/sign-mac-build.sh).

The mac app can be deployed both via Steam (see [GameCI 6: Conclusion](gameci-6_conclusion.html)) and via the Mac App Store (see below), but the `Zip App` and `Upload Zip to GitHub Release` steps also enable players to get the build from the GitHub Releases page.
Note that the `Upload Zip to GitHub Release` step requires a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Deploy to the Mac App Store

{% highlight yml %}
{% raw %}
  deployToMacAppStore:
    name: Deploy to the Mac App Store
    runs-on: macos-latest
    needs: buildWithMac
    if: github.event.action == 'published' || (contains(github.event.inputs.workflow_mode, 'release') && contains(github.event.inputs.workflow_mode, 'StandaloneOSX'))
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Download iOS Artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: cgs-StandaloneOSX
          path: build/StandaloneOSX
      - name: Update Release Notes
        if: github.event.action == 'published'
        env:
          RELEASE_NOTES: ${{ github.event.release.body }}
        run: echo "$RELEASE_NOTES" > fastlane/metadata/en-US/release_notes.txt
      - name: Run Fastlane
        env:
          APPLE_CONNECT_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.APPLE_CONNECT_EMAIL }}
          APPLE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.APPLE_DEVELOPER_EMAIL }}
          APPLE_TEAM_ID: ${{ secrets.APPLE_TEAM_ID }}
          APPLE_TEAM_NAME: ${{ secrets.APPLE_TEAM_NAME }}
          APPSTORE_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.APPSTORE_KEY_ID }}
          APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID: ${{ secrets.APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID }}
          APPSTORE_P8: ${{ secrets. APPSTORE_P8 }}
          MAC_BUILD_PATH: ${{ format('{0}/build/StandaloneOSX', github.workspace) }}
          MAC_BUNDLE_ID: com.finoldigital.CardGameSimulator
          PROJECT_NAME: Card Game Simulator
        run: |
          bundle install
          bundle exec fastlane mac macupload
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This job only runs when triggered by either a GitHub Release or a workflow dispatch with `release StandaloneOSX` as the input.
This job takes the signed mac app and uses fastlane to build and deploy to the App Store.

Now that [MacOS can run iOS apps](https://support.apple.com/guide/app-store/iphone-ipad-apps-mac-apple-silicon-fird2c7092da/mac), it's probably better to avoid the Mac App Store.
If you'd like additional details anyway, refer to the [fastlane docs](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/appstore/).

        run: |
          find $IOS_BUILD_PATH -type f -name "**.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
          find $IOS_BUILD_PATH -type f -iname "usymtool" -exec chmod +x {} \;
          bundle install
          bundle exec fastlane ios release
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This job only runs when triggered by either a GitHub Release or a workflow dispatch with `release iOS` as the input.
This job takes the iOS Xcode project (which was built in [GameCI 3: Build and Deploy with Linux](gameci-3_linux.html)) and uses fastlane to build and deploy to the App Store.

For additional details about iOS builds and deployment, refer to the [GameCI iOS docs](https://game.ci/docs/github/deployment/ios).
